	<h2 class="text_center">About Social Travel Guide</h2>
    <p>This web application lets your social network know about your travel plans and allow friends to post travel suggestions for your itinerary. This helps to create a better travelling experience for you as the activities are based on your friends’ own experiences or “word of mouth”. It also helps you save time from researching for your own itinerary; just let your friends do some or all the work for you. You may then mix and match your friends’ suggestions and create your own unique travel itinerary for your dream vacation.</p>

	<p>The application will utilize a calendar plugin for selecting travel dates, GoogleMaps API for visualizing geography and routes, a photo upload mechanism for showing pictures, and a social network plugin for sharing your travel plans on Facebook. MySQL database will be used to store user information and data, and the language used to develop the site will be HTML, PHP and JavaScript.</p>
