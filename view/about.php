    <p>This web application lets your social network know about your travel plans and allow friends to post travel suggestions for your itinerary. This helps to create a better travelling experience for you as the activities are based on your friends’ own experiences or “word of mouth”. It also helps you save time from researching for your own itinerary; just let your friends do some or all the work for you. You may then mix and match your friends’ suggestions and create your own unique travel itinerary for your dream vacation.</p>
